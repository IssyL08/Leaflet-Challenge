### Leaflet-Challenge

Using the https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php 

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
